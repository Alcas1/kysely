# Select individual columns

A very basic example that selects a subset of table's columns. You can give an alias
for a selection using `as`.

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
  exampleSelectIndividualColumns
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

<Playground code={exampleSelectIndividualColumns} setupCode={exampleSetup} />

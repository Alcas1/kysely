# Select all columns of a table

The `selectAll` method can also be used to select all columns of a single table.
Another thing to note in this example is that all `select` methods are additive
meaning you can call them multiple times and the selections add up.

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
  exampleSelectAllColumnsOfATable
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

<Playground code={exampleSelectAllColumnsOfATable} setupCode={exampleSetup} />

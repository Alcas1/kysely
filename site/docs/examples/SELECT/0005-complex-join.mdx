# Complex join

If your join condition is more complex than `a = b` you can pass a callback as the second argument to the join method.
In this example we use `leftJoin` but all join methods take the same arguments.

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
  exampleComplexJoin,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

<Playground code={exampleComplexJoin} setupCode={exampleSetup} />

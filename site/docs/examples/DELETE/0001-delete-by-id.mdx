# Delete a record by id

Notice that when deleting we use `deleteFrom` instead of `selectFrom`.

The `where` method works the same way as with `selectFrom`. See the [SELECT](/docs/category/select) section 
for examples on how to work with the `where` method.

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
  exampleDeleteById,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

<Playground code={exampleDeleteById} setupCode={exampleSetup} />

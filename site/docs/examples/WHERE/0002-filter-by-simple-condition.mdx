# Filter by simple condition

In this example we're using `.where` to find all persons aged between 18 and 60. 
As you can see, multiple calls to `where` get connected by `AND`.

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
  exampleFilterBySimpleCondition,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

<Playground code={exampleFilterBySimpleCondition} setupCode={exampleSetup} />

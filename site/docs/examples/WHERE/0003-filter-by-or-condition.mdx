# Filter by `OR` condition

In this example we build a more complex `WHERE` statement that uses both `AND` and `OR`.
We use the `and` method of the [ExpressionBuilder](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/interfaces/ExpressionBuilder.html) 
here but we could've split this into two `where` calls just as well.

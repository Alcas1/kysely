# Update a record by id

Notice that when updating we use `updateTable` instead of `selectFrom`, and `.set` 
goes before the `.where`, just like it does in regular SQL. 

The `where` method works the same way as with `selectFrom`. See the [SELECT](/docs/category/select) section 
for examples on how to work with the `where` method.
